## **What Is an AWS Region?**

An **AWS Region** is a physical location around the world where AWS clusters its data centers. Each AWS Region is composed of multiple, isolated, and physically separate **[[Availability Zone|Availability Zones (AZs)]]**, providing a robust, secure, and highly available infrastructure.

- 🏢 **Data Centers Grouping:**
    - Each group of logical data centers is referred to as an **[[Availability Zone|Availability Zones]]**.
- 🌐 **Multiple AZs per Region:**
    - Every AWS Region consists of a **minimum of three** AZs.
- 🔒 **Independent Infrastructure:**
    - Each AZ has its own **power, cooling,** and **physical security**, connected via **redundant, ultra-low-latency networks**.
- 💡 **High Availability:**
    - The multi-AZ design allows you to design applications that are **highly [[Fault Tolerance (FT)|fault tolerant]]** by deploying them across multiple AZs.

## **Advantages of AWS Regions**

- **Geographic Isolation:**
    - 🌐 **Disaster Resilience:**
        - Regions are **geographically isolated**, ensuring that data remains safe even if a disaster impacts one region.
- **Location Control:**
    - 📍 **Proximity to Customers:**
        - You can choose regions close to your customers to reduce latency and enhance performance.
- **High Security & Compliance:**
    - 🔐 **Data Protection:**
        - AWS Regions meet the highest levels of **security, compliance,** and **data protection**, ensuring your data is secure.

## **Region Codes & Names**

- **Region Code:**
    - 🏷️ When referring to a region in your configurations, you use a **region code**.
    - **Example:** `ap-southeast-2`
- **Region Name:**
    - 🗺️ Along with the region code, each region also has a **region name** for clarity.
    - **Example:** `Asia Pacific (Sydney)`
- **Examples of AWS Regions:**
    - **US Regions:**
        - N. Virginia, Ohio, N. California, Oregon
    - **Global Regions:**
        - Examples also include regions in Europe, Asia Pacific, South America, and more.

    - High availability, fault tolerance, and security.
    - Geographically isolated for enhanced disaster resilience.
    - Ability to serve customers close to their location with low latency.
- **Identification:**
    - Regions are identified by a **region code** (e.g., `ap-southeast-2`) and a **region name** (e.g., `Asia Pacific (Sydney)`).
