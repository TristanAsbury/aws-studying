### Minimize Outages

Aims to ensure an agreed level of operation performance, usually uptime, for a higher than normal period.

- Misconception: HA doesnt mean that it will never go down
	- HA is made so that it can be fixed and come back up as quick as possible
	- **HA is not about user experience**, if the system goes down for bit, thats okay. Its about maximizing its time online
	- **Example**: If youre driving in a desert with a 4x4 and get a flat. If you don't have a spare, then the car is not Highly Available, if you do, then we can get the tire replaced and therefore the car has minimized downtime and its more highly available.
