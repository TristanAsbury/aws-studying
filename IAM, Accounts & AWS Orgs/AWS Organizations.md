## **What is AWS Organizations?**

**AWS Organizations** is a management service that helps you centrally manage and govern multiple [[AWS Account|AWS Accounts]]. It enables you to organize accounts into a hierarchical structure for simplified billing, security, and operational efficiency.

- **Centralized Management:**
    - 🔄 Manage multiple AWS accounts from a single, central location.
- **Streamlined Billing:**
    - 💳 Consolidate billing across accounts to take advantage of volume pricing and simplify expense management.
- **Governance and Control:**
    - 🔒 Apply policies and guardrails across your entire organization to ensure compliance and security best practices.

## **Key Components**

### **1. Management (Master) Account**

- 🏆 **Central Account:**
    - The management account is the primary account used to create the organization and manage other member accounts.
- 💡 **Billing & Policy Hub:**
    - Responsible for consolidated billing and managing Service Control Policies (SCPs) across the organization.

### **2. Member Accounts**
- 👥 **Child Accounts:**
    - These are the accounts that are part of the organization, managed centrally through the management account.
- 🔄 **Autonomous but Governed:**
    - Each member account retains its own resources and services but is subject to the policies set at the organization level.
- 🤝Create member accounts directly within the organization. 
	- Doesn't require invites.

### **3. Organizational Units (OUs)**
- 📂 **Hierarchical Grouping:**
    - Organize accounts into OUs based on criteria such as business function, environment (production, development, testing), or security requirements.
- 🗂 **Policy Inheritance:**
    - [[#**4. Service Control Policies (SCPs)**|SCPs]] can be attached to OUs, and all accounts within an OU inherit those policies.

### **4. Service Control Policies (SCPs)**
- 📜 **Central Permission Guardrails:**
    - SCPs are policies that define the maximum available permissions for accounts in your organization.
- 🔒 **Restrictive by Nature:**
    - They restrict what actions can be performed, regardless of the permissions granted at the account or IAM level.
- 🌐 **Global Policies:**
    - SCPs ensure that security and compliance rules are consistently applied across all accounts in your organization.

## **Core Features**

### **Consolidated Billing**

- 💳 **Unified Payment:**
    - All member accounts consolidate their usage and costs under the [[#**1. Management (Master) Account**|Management Account]], allowing for simplified budgeting and potential cost savings through volume discounts.
- 🔍 **Detailed Reporting:**
    - Get detailed cost and usage reports across the entire organization.

### **Centralized Governance**

- 🔧 **Policy Enforcement:**
    - Use SCPs to enforce policies that restrict or allow specific actions across all accounts.
- 🛡 **Compliance & Security:**
    - Ensure all accounts adhere to your organization’s security standards and compliance requirements.

### **Automated Account Creation**

- 🚀 **Streamlined Setup:**
    - Easily create new AWS accounts and add them to your organization.
- 🗃 **Pre-configured Structure:**
    - New accounts can be automatically placed into the appropriate OUs with the required SCPs in place.

### **Resource Sharing**

- 🔄 **Cross-Account Sharing:**
    - Share resources such as VPCs, Transit Gateways, and License Manager configurations across accounts within your organization.

## **Common Use Cases**

### **1. Security and Compliance**

- 🔒 **Guardrails for Permissions:**
    - Use Service Control Policies (SCPs) to restrict actions that could compromise security, ensuring even if local IAM policies are too permissive, the organization-level guardrails keep your environment safe.
- 🏛 **Regulatory Compliance:**
    - Enforce policies that meet specific regulatory requirements across all accounts.

### **2. Cost Management**

- 💰 **Centralized Billing:**
    - Consolidate billing to benefit from volume discounts and simplify financial tracking.
- 📊 **Cost Allocation:**
    - Track and allocate costs to different departments, projects, or environments using tags and consolidated billing reports.

### **3. Operational Efficiency**
- ⚙️ **Environment Segregation:**
    - Organize accounts into OUs for development, testing, and production to isolate environments and reduce risk.
- 🤝 **Cross-Account Collaboration:**
    - Facilitate collaboration between teams and business units while maintaining strict control over permissions and billing.

### **4. Scaling Your Organization**
- 🚀 **Automated Account Provisioning:**
    - Quickly spin up new accounts for new projects or teams, with predefined security and billing settings.
- 📈 **Future-Proof Structure:**
    - As your organization grows, AWS Organizations scales with you, managing thousands of accounts if needed.

## **Best Practices**

- **Least Privilege with SCPs:**
    - Always start with the principle of least privilege. Use SCPs to restrict unnecessary permissions and only allow what’s required.
- **Organize by Function:**
    - Group accounts into OUs based on business function, environment, or regulatory requirements to simplify policy management.
- **Monitor and Audit:**
    - Regularly review your consolidated billing, SCPs, and account configurations to ensure compliance and optimize costs.
- **Automate Where Possible:**
    - Use AWS Organizations APIs or AWS CloudFormation StackSets to automate the creation and configuration of accounts and policies.

## **Limitations and Considerations**

- **Policy Inheritance:**
    - Remember that SCPs apply to all IAM entities within an account. Ensure that your policies are designed to avoid accidentally blocking necessary permissions.
- **Management Account Sensitivity:**
    - The management account holds significant power over the entire organization. Ensure it is secured with multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strict access controls.
- **Service Control vs. IAM Policies:**
    - SCPs set the maximum permissions available; they do not grant permissions. IAM policies within individual accounts further define what actions can be performed.
