A **Nameserver** is a specialized server that stores and manages DNS (Domain Name System) records for a domain. When you type a website address into your browser, the nameserver helps direct your request to the correct server by providing the necessary information (such as the website’s IP address).

### **Notes Outline for Nameserver**

1. **Purpose**
    - **Stores DNS Records:** Holds important [[DNS Record Type|records]] (like A, AAAA, MX, etc.) that tell computers where to find your website or service.
    - **Directs Traffic:** Helps route internet requests to the correct server by translating domain names into IP addresses.

2. **How It Works**
    - **Query Process:**
        - When you enter a domain (e.g., `example.com`) in your browser, a DNS query is sent out.
        - The query first reaches a [[Root Server|root server]], then moves to a TLD ([[Top-Level Domain (TLD) Server|Top-Level Domain]]) server, and finally to the nameserver responsible for the domain.
    - **Response:**
        - The nameserver returns the relevant DNS record (e.g., an A record with the website’s IP address).
        - Your browser then uses this information to connect to the website's server.

3. **Role in Domain Management**
    - **Domain Registration:** When you register a domain, you specify which nameservers will manage your domain’s DNS records.
    - **Flexibility:** You can change nameservers if you switch web hosting providers, allowing you to update where your domain points without changing the domain name itself.

4. **Key Points to Remember**
    - **Central to the Internet:** Nameservers are essential for the functioning of the internet, as they enable the translation of human-friendly domain names into machine-readable IP addresses.
    - **Managed by Providers:** Often, your domain registrar or web hosting provider will supply nameservers, though you can also use third-party DNS services for added features or reliability.
